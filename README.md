2. variables.py - variables will be used everywhere past this point.
3. printing.py - printing will be used in all examples later than this one.
4. stringConcatenation.py - shows how to combine strings, will be used in some future lessons.
5. stringFuncs.py - shows how to get the length of a string and other such things.
